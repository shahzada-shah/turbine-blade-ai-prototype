## 🎯 What This Shows Hiring Managers

### Technical Skills
- **Full ML Pipeline**: Data → Training → Evaluation → Deployment
- **Production Engineering**: Docker, testing, CI/CD
- **Model Understanding**: Model cards, evaluation metrics, limitations
- **Explainable AI**: Grad-CAM for model interpretability

### Best Practices
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs for users and developers
- **Testing**: Unit tests and evaluation scripts
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready for production
- **Monitoring**: Error handling and logging

### Business Impact
- **Decision Logic**: Translates ML to operational actions
- **Safety Considerations**: Blade-type-specific thresholds
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Recommendations, not autonomous decisions

## 📊 Key Metrics to Highlight

- **Model Accuracy**: 67% overall (with per-class metrics)
- **Evaluation Rigor**: Confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1
- **Explainability**: Grad-CAM attention visualization
- **Production Ready**: Docker, tests, CI/CD

## 💡 Talking Points for Interviews

1. **"I built an end-to-end ML system"** - Not just training, but full pipeline
2. **"I implemented explainable AI"** - Grad-CAM shows model reasoning
3. **"I designed for production"** - Docker, testing, error handling
4. **"I documented model limitations"** - Model card shows ML maturity
5. **"I converted ML outputs to business actions"** - Decision logic layer

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Add more training data (improve accuracy)
- [ ] Implement model versioning (MLflow)
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks (inference time)
- [ ] Create training metrics visualization
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)
